Hello... I am Niyaz Malik...a 21 year old guy who is pursuing BTech from BS ANANGPURIA college, Faridabad. Right now I am in 2nd year and about to enter 3rd year in 3 months and I haven't worked on my skills yet. I was never consistent although I hold potential to acheive alot. I was a game adddict since class 11th up untill now and finally ALHAMDULILLAH now at the very crucial time I woke up or should i say THE ALMIGHTY guided me... I have roughly 1.5 years of my college life left (excluded 0.5 year coz last sem is internship time) to acheive all the necessary skills. May THE ALMIGHTY guide me coz if now i don't take things seriously then life is not going to show mercy at all...
